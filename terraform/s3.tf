# This file contains the configuration for the S3 bucket and DynamoDB table
# used for storing Terraform state and locking.
# It creates an S3 bucket with versioning and server-side encryption enabled,
# and a DynamoDB table for state locking.
# The S3 bucket is configured to block public access and has tags for identification.
# The DynamoDB table is created with on-demand billing mode and a hash key for locking.
